# Introduction

To get a more complete picture of academic achievement of a student or a school, itâ€™s important to look at both average performance and variability within a cluster. We adapted the mixed-effects location scale model
(MELSM) using the Spike and Slab regularization technique to shrink the *scale* random effects to their fixed effect. This allows us to identify clusters with unusually (in)consistent academic achievement.

### Model formulation

The random effects from the scale and location can be modeled as, $\textbf{u}\sim\mathcal{N}(\textbf{0}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma})$. The covariance matrix of the random effects can be decomposed into $\boldsymbol\Sigma = \boldsymbol{\tau}\boldsymbol{\Omega\tau}'$ to specify independent priors for each element of $\boldsymbol{\tau}$ (random-effects standard deviations) and $\boldsymbol{\Omega}$ (correlation matrix among all random effects).

$\boldsymbol\Omega$ can be factorized via the Cholesky $\textbf{L}$ of $\boldsymbol\Omega = \textbf{L}'\textbf{L}$. Then, $\textbf{u}$ can be recovered multiplying $\textbf{L}$ by the random effect standard deviations, $\boldsymbol{\tau}$, and scaling it with a standard normally distributed $\boldsymbol{z}$.

An indicator variable ($\delta$) is included in the prior for the scale random effect to allow switching between the spike and slab throughout the MCMC sampling process. For each school $j$, we obtain a probabilistic measure on whether the scale random effect is to be included or not: 

$$\textbf{u}_j = \boldsymbol{\tau}\textbf{L}\color{red}{\boldsymbol{\delta}}_j\textbf{z}_j$$
For a random intercept only model,

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mm_delta}
\alpha_{0j} = \begin{cases}
\eta_{0}, & \text{if }\delta_j = 0 , \\
\eta_{0} + u_{0j}, & \text{if }\delta_j = 1
\end{cases}.
\end{equation}

The posterior inclusion probabilities (PIP) can then be computed as

\begin{align}
Pr(\alpha_{0j} = \eta_{0} | \textbf{Y}) = 1 - \frac{1}{S} \sum_{s = 1}^S \delta_{js},
\end{align}

where $S = \{1,...,s\}$ denotes the posterior samples and $\eta_{0}$ is the average within-person variability.


The methods have been implemented in the R package [`ivd`](https://github.com/consistentlyBetter/ivd):

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
devtools::install_github("consistentlybetter/ivd")
```



# Illustrative example

The data comes from The Basic Education Evaluation System (Saeb) conducted by Brazil's National Institute for Educational Studies and Research (Inep). It is also available as the `saeb` dataset in the `ivd` package. The outcome variable is `math_proficiency` at the end of grade 12. Location and scale are modeled as a function of student and school SES. 


```{r plots, include=FALSE}
p2 <- plot.ivd(out, "funnel")
p3 <- plot.ivd(out, "outcome")
```


```{r funnel-plot, echo=FALSE,dpi=300,out.width="80%", fig.align='center', fig.cap="Funnel plot of posterior inclusion probabilities and school's standard deviations. Higher PIP values express more evidence for the random effect of a given school to be included in the model."}
p2 +
  theme_minimal()
```




```{r y-plot, echo=FALSE, dpi=300,out.width="80%",fig.align='center', fig.cap="Posterior inclusion probabilities plotted against school's average math achievement in standardized units. Point size represents within-school standard deviation."}
p3 +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Math achievement (z-standardized)")
```
# Discussion

- Individual variance detection analysis suggests that some schools have students consistently performing above the average, while others have an average mean score but with greater-than-average variability. Inconsistent performance may reflect unaccounted factors influencing learning.

- The IVD method could also be used to assess academic performance throughout the year and uncover information relevant to providing more specific school or student support.
